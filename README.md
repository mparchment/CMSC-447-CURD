This is a basic CURD application that takes in a test database comprised of a user's name and points.
The application allows creating new users, reading and searching for users in the database, updating user names and points, along with deleting users from the database.

To get started with running the application, install any dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then deploy using `flask run`.

- To create a new user, click the "Create" tab, then enter the user name and points. To add the user to the table, click the "Add User" button.
- To search for a user within the table, click the "Search" tab, and enter the name of the user. The user matching the name will be filtered out and shown.
- To delete a user from the database, click on the row belonging to the user, and click the button "Delete Selected Users".
- To update a user's name or amount of points within the table, select the user from the dropdown, and enter the new data.
